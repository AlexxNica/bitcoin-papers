Oleg Andreev's Bitcoin Research and Development
===============================================

[Bitcoin Blind Signatures](BitcoinBlindSignatures.md). Distribute control over bitcoins between multiple custodians while maintaining absolute privacy. Custodians only authenticate you in person and allow or deny a transaction, but never know the contents of the transaction.

[Automatic Encrypted Wallet Backups](AutomaticEncryptedWalletBackups.md) (BIP proposal). Bitcoin wallets normally require careful backup for only its master seed. The scheme allows to encrypt all external information (payment receipts, notes etc.) using that master seed and automatically upload to one or more hosting services (iCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive) to be automatically downloaded and installed during restore process.
